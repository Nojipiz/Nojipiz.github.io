# Hello fellow developers!

A pretty simple software developer portfolio, contains a little bit about me and my work :D

## Tech Stack
This is first approach to [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) targets, i have chose [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) + [Yew framework](https://yew.rs/) to create this site.

Also, the state management runs over [Yewdux](https://github.com/intendednull/yewdux), which obviously is the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) equivalent for Yew.

The styles has been created with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), because how likes plain css? ._. 
And the Yew styles alternatives are a work in progress right now.

## Do you want to run  the project?
Yeah sure but you will need a lot of dependencies and Rust stuff, the live demo is [here](https://nojipiz.github.io/)

### Dependencies: 
- Rust
- wasm-pack 
- npm or yarn
- Node

Once you have the dependencies, you can start the server running:
```sh
npm start
```

## Why a moon.
*Take your code to the moon*, i have heard this phrase somewhere, and sound good for a strange reason, but contains the word *moon* so ...
I just put a moon in my page. 
The 3D model has been created by me with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), and exported [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/), this is the only part that isn't WASM in the project, it must be imported and run by Typescript.

## Inspiration
I was checking a lot of others developers portfolios, here is a list of the most inspiring for me.
